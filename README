puppet apply --debug --verbose --modulepath=$(pwd)/modules manifests/default.pp

MANUAL STUFF

- install xcode 
- install homebrew and then git (todo: puppet homebrew and find a non-git way of pulling the repo first time)
- install emacs - just cancel when it is doing it (run with debug flag) and do it manually... for some reason ignoring the flags and just installing v 23 when I required head
- install java - on lion, for some reason you can just type in java and it figures it out
